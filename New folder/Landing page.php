         <p>Over the years, most students and universities have no track of which projects has been done and to what extent was the research. For quality to come out of the final year projects that the students involve in
            there need to be a track of what's been done, what needs to been done and what improvements needs to be brought on table.</p>
         <p>Project pool has therefore been created with an aim of bringing quality in our education system and even the research sector by having all universities and projects in one pool</p>
         <p>Universities can therefore register and keep documents of all undergraduate projects that has been done over the years in one meuseum.</p>
